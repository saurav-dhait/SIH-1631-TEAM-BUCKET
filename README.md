<h3 align="left">Background</h3>

###

<p align="left">Currently, stakeholders must individually contact each college through phone 📞, email 📧, or personal visits 🏢 to obtain necessary details. This process is time-consuming ⏳ and inefficient 🚫. Our solution aims to streamline these inquiries by deploying an AI-based virtual assistant capable of providing real-time responses 🕐, available 24/7 🌐.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Key Features:</h3>

###

<p align="left">Efficient Information Retrieval 🔍: The chatbot uses AI to quickly access a database, delivering accurate information on a wide range of topics like admissions 📝, scholarships 💸, and placements 💼.<br><br>NLP and Voice Assistance 🎤: The system supports English language input with future extensions planned for Hindi 🇮🇳 and other regional languages, ensuring wider accessibility 🌍.<br>Reduced Workload 📉: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), the system allows department staff 👨‍💻 to focus on more complex queries.<br><br>4) Data Insights 📊: The system gathers valuable data from user interactions, helping the department refine and optimize its services 🔧.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Multi-Agent Architecture 🛠️: </h3>

###

<p align="left">The chatbot employs a Multi-Agent Architecture—a system composed of multiple AI agents 🤖 collaborating to answer queries. Each agent works independently 🧠 with distributed intelligence, ensuring fast ⚡ and accurate ✅ results. The system incorporates self-reflection 🧐 and Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) for enhanced precision 🎯.</p>
