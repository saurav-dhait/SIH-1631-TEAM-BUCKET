<h2 align="left">Our topic: AI-Powered Chatbot for Rajasthan Technical Education</h2>

###

<h3 align="left">Project Description:</h3>

###

<p align="left">The AI-Powered Chatbot is developed to assist stakeholdersâ€”students, parents, and other interested partiesâ€”by providing timely and accurate information related to admissions, eligibility criteria, scholarships, fee structure, hostel facilities, and placement opportunities for engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan, operating under the Department of Technical Education.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Background</h3>

###

<p align="left">Currently, stakeholders must individually contact each college through phone, email, or personal visits to obtain necessary details. This process is time-consuming and inefficient. Our solution aims to streamline these inquiries by deploying an AI-based virtual assistant capable of providing real-time responses, available 24/7.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Key Features:</h3>

###

<p align="left">1) Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot uses AI to quickly access a database, delivering accurate information on a wide range of topics like admissions, scholarships, and placements.<br><br>2) NLP and Voice Assistance: The system supports English language input with future extensions planned for Hindi and other regional languages, ensuring wider accessibility.<br><br>3) Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), the system allows department staff to focus on more complex queries.<br><br>4) Data Insights: The system gathers valuable data from user interactions, helping the department refine and optimize its services.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Multi-Agent Architecture:</h3>

###

<p align="left">The chatbot employs a Multi-Agent Architectureâ€”a system composed of multiple AI agents collaborating to answer queries. Each agent works independently with distributed intelligence, ensuring fast and accurate results. The system incorporates self-reflection and Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) for enhanced precision.</p>
